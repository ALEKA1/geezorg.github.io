1) I   agree with you for choosing the line of "Ne" as a basis to  =20
    construct the line above "nge".
=20
2) I prefer the final, 3rd cell, but as I look at the perfectly =
horizontal line,=20
    it seems to me that it is a little bit too rigidly horizontal. I =
hope this
    rigidity will disappear once the line is divided into two small =
parts,to
    fit the line above the "ge".  It is good if you raise the flanks =
very=20
    slightly, to avoid the rigidity.

3) The proportion of the horizontal line seems too big. I measured it,
     and it is about 1.5 cm.  The upper horizontal body of the "ge" is
     about 1.1 cm. I would prefer that the horizontal line above the =
"ge"
     to be almost of the same length as the upper body of the"ge" , or
     only with a very minor length at its right flank


4) When I looked to the 7 Ge,ez syllabary you presented, the 7th
     syllabary "je" (Japan) impressed my attention. The above horizontal
    line of this letter seems more proportional to the rest of the body =
of  =20
   the letter; and it is not bulging out unproportionally, on its right =
or left
   flanks. The size of the flanks is moderate. May be you can try to put
   the same horizontal line above the"ge", and see how it  looks.
===============================================================================

1) a little bit widening of the joining lines, as you said, plus the=20
    "ng" ring and its joining line to the horizontal to be of the same
    size(thikness).
2) The "ngo" looks very nice now. If you move the joining
     line at the foot of the ring a little bit to the right (backwards), =

     plus, make the left side of the ring thinner, by adding a little
     bit thicknes to the right side of the ring. I am planing to send=20
     my last suggesion about the ring itself later on.

3) If you are planing to associate this "nge" family letters with=20
    Ge'ezNet letters in practical use, then you can look at the=20
    flowers of the horizontal line with those of Ge'ezNet, and see
    if there is a need to make it look alike. I prefer your way of=20
    designing the flowers, than those of GeezNet. If you are
    planing to make a complete Ge'ez software of your own, then
    there is no need to make any change .
===============================================================================
I will work on the enhancements you noted.  The ring used with "ngo" is
taken direcly from "Qo" but shrunken to 80%.  So the thickness left and
right is still proportional with "Qo".  I need to detail these steps in
the web page.
===============================================================================
In the next font version I'll include the "ge" family that the
"nge" family is derived from.  I do think the "ngwe" is too tall,
it is based on the corresponding "gwe" which is also too tall.
I don't know why they (MonoType) did that, but I will correct it.
===============================================================================
You can get now http://blin.geez.org/tekie3.exe which has an
updated font and a document.  The changes are mostly for the
heights of the labialized "ng" letters (except ngwa) and some
trials with "ng".  If you type the letters 0 - 9 now they have
the original "g" letters that the "ng" are derived from.
===============================================================================

I am very much pleased with the final letters in Tekie exe.3 that you =
sent me.
Their hight, which I forgot to mention to you, even though I was aware =
of it, is now perfect. As it is said, "there is always a room
for improvement", I can only mention one or two points that you are also =
aware of, and they are about "ng and ngo". =20

On  "ng", what about making the line upon which the top structure falls =
a little bit wider? I mean, only a very minor width, proportionally =
thiner than the above structure line passing through it.
On "ngo", what about making the ring still smaller than it is now, so =
that its joining points to the above structure and the "ge" can be more =
visible than they are now?=20
I am not sure at all, if the above suggestions can make the letters
any more nicer, as they look very nice to me now. I hope you
will stop me here, so that we can conclude this endless creative
play with the form and structure of letters.
As I read your old mails, I found your question about "nesela sereth" on =
Kiflemariams writings. I was not aware of this, but
I can only say that we have no suggestions for punctuation
marks for Blin, different than those for Amharic or Tirigna
